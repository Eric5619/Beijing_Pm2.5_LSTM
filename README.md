## Project Overview
The assignment provides an opportunity for students to develop a Long Short Term
Memory (LSTM) network for time series analysis using Python. LSTM networks are
a type of Recurrent neural network. The big advantage of LSTM models is to
persistently accumulate propagation states over the input sequence, that is, the output
of the model from one timestep is provided as an input in the subsequent timestep of
the model. This feature allows the model to make a prediction based on both the input
for the current timestep and prior knowledge derived in the previous timestep,
resulting in more stable prediction results.

This project aims to predict PM2.5 levels in Beijing using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The LSTM model is designed to capture temporal dependencies in time-series data, making it suitable for air quality prediction tasks. This project is part of my coursework, demonstrating practical skills in data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation using deep learning techniques.
